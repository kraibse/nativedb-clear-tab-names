## Installation

1. **Install a Userscript Manager**
   - For Chrome: [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
   - For Firefox: [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
   - For Safari: [Userscripts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887)

2. **Install the Script**
   - Click on the userscript manager icon in your browser
   - Select "Create new script"
   - Copy and paste the entire script from `title-updater.user.js`
   - Save the script (usually Ctrl+S or âŒ˜+S)

## How It Works

The script uses a MutationObserver to monitor changes to the DOM on NativeDB pages. When it detects changes that affect the `.title>h1` element, it updates the browser tab title to match the content of this element.

```javascript
// Example of the core functionality
function updateTitle() {
    const titleElement = document.querySelector('.title>h1');
    if (titleElement) {
        document.title = titleElement.textContent.trim();
    }
}
```
